# WeThePeople
Implements democracy in Bannerlord, allowing for kingdoms to turn into republics.
For more information, [see the Nexus page for the mod.](https://www.nexusmods.com/mountandblade2bannerlord/mods/7793?tab=description])

The information on the Nexus mods page will be moved here before We the People 2 is released (which I may also open source that once it is ready).
# Note:
This is old code, and hasn't been touched in months. I did uncomment some lines so it works, but that is it. It may not be entirely functional, as it is the last development version I left it in, which is after the final release on Nexus. It is also not the best written code, and I have learned a lot since I wrote this. It won't be updated again, as it has been dropped in favor of a complete rewrite, with a slight change in focus. Mostly put up just to have it apart of my portfolio.
